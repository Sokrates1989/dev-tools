Write a concise and meaningful **merge commit message only** based on the source and target branch names and the purpose of the merge. DO NOT include git commands or code blocks.

Follow this format strictly, using one line only:

[MERGE | targetBranch -> sourceBranch] Merged feature: short summary of the change.

Replace "Merged feature:" with one of these where applicable:
- Merged feature:
- Merged hotfix:
- Merged cleanup:
- Merged update:
- Merged refactoring:
- Merged integration:

Keep the summary under 18 words. Replace sourceBranch and targetBranch with the real branch names.

⚠️ Respond ONLY with the final **message line** (no code block, no git command, no commentary).
