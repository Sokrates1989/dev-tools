Write a merge commit message based on the source and target branch names and the purpose of the merge.

Follow this format exactly, using one line only and be very concise:

git commit -m "[MERGE | sourceBranch -> targetBranch] Merged feature: short summary of the change."

Replace "Merged feature:" appropriately with one of these where applicable:

Merged feature:
Merged hotfix:
Merged cleanup:
Merged update:
Merged refactoring:
Merged integration:

Keep the summary under 18 words. Use real branch names in sourceBranch and targetBranch.
Respond only with the final bash command.
