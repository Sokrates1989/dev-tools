Replace every occurrence of ``` with ;;; so that the output changes from this:

```dart
// Example usage.
```

```json
json
```

```bash
# bash content.
```

```anthing
...
```



to this:

;;;dart
// Example usage.
;;;

;;;json
json
;;;

;;;bash
# bash content.
;;;

;;;anthing
...
;;;




Ensure, that I can copy the readme to the clipboard directly, by wrapping the whole output in

``` markdown
PUT THE WHOLE OUTPUT WITHIN THESE LINES
```


To emphasize this there should be not one occurence of ``` in the markdown!!

``` markdown
NOT ONE ``` in here -> All changed to ;;;
```
